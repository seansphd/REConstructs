Analyzing **Dunetune**—a computer-generated poem created using the BARD 1D program—through the systems thinking terms **Fixed Constants, Variables, Interaction, Feedback,** and **Emergence** provides insight into the collaborative, computer-assisted approach to poetry generation that combines structure with creative flexibility.

### Fixed Constants

In the creation of **Dunetune**, **fixed constants** establish the foundational rules and parameters within which the computer generates poetry. These include:

- **BARD 1D Program Structure:** The BARD 1D program is a constant framework designed to select and arrange elements (words or phrases) according to predefined rules. This program functions primarily as an element selector and arranger, with basic rules governing element order, layout, and repetition rate, while leaving higher-level creative input to the poet.

- **Open Form Structure:** Dunetune uses an open form, meaning there is no fixed structure in which words or phrases are slotted. Instead, elements are arranged in a chain of variable length. This openness reflects a key constant in the program’s design, differentiating it from closed forms with rigid frameworks, and mirroring the flexibility and unpredictability found in natural language.

- **Critical Faculty to Prevent Excessive Repetition:** The program incorporates a critical mechanism to monitor repetition rates, ensuring that elements do not become overly repetitive. Each element has a probability factor that decreases with each repetition, but there is no absolute rule preventing any specific element from reappearing. This limited control over repetition introduces a balance between structured guidance and flexibility in the output.

- **Element Tags for Selection Criteria:** Each word or phrase element is tagged with properties that guide the program’s selection process, restricting choices to elements that meet specific criteria. These tags ensure that selected elements adhere to basic characteristics appropriate for the intended theme or tone of the poem.

These constants ensure that the program operates within a consistent structural framework, providing coherence in each poem while allowing room for flexibility and surprise.

### Variables

**Variables** in the BARD 1D system introduce adaptability, allowing poets to influence the poetic style and thematic qualities of the output. Key variables include:

- **Element Deck (Content of the Elements):** The element deck, which consists of words and phrases written by the poet, can vary widely, introducing diverse language, themes, and tones. In Dunetune, for example, the deck is specifically crafted with language inspired by Frank Herbert’s *Dune*, which shapes the content and mood of the poem. This variable allows poets to tailor the vocabulary and thematic focus of each piece.

- **Selection Criteria Tags:** The poet can adjust the selection tags, modifying which elements are eligible at each stage of the poem’s assembly. These tags act as filters, guiding the selection process according to the poet’s thematic or structural goals, such as emphasizing certain moods or imagery.

- **Repetition Probability Factor:** Each element has an individual probability factor for repetition, which decays at a rate determined by the poet. By adjusting these decay rates, poets can control how frequently elements reappear, influencing the rhythm and consistency of the poem. For example, high-decay elements might only appear once, while low-decay elements could recur.

- **General Condition Constraints:** The poet can set a “general condition” to guide the poem’s overall structure or layout. While Dunetune did not specify a particular condition, this variable can be adapted for other poems, adding another layer of constraint to the element selection process and influencing the shape or flow of the poem.

These variables allow poets to adapt the output to suit their stylistic preferences, giving each computer-generated poem a unique flavor and coherence.

### Interaction

**Interaction** in Dunetune’s creation process is the dynamic relationship between the poet, the BARD 1D program, and the generated poem. Key interaction elements include:

- **Collaboration between Poet and Program:** The poet provides the content (element deck) and parameters, while the program arranges and selects elements based on quasi-random number generation and programmed constraints. This interaction creates a collaborative environment where the poet’s creative input shapes the possible outcomes without controlling every detail.

- **Guided Randomness in Element Selection:** The program’s quasi-random number generator determines which elements are selected at each step, but this randomness is shaped by the poet’s tags, constraints, and repetition controls. This interaction between randomness and structure enables unpredictable yet cohesive poetic outcomes, balancing surprise with thematic consistency.

- **Dynamic Feedback Loop in Repetition Control:** As elements are repeated, their probability of re-selection decreases, adding a dynamic layer of interaction between previous selections and future choices. This mechanism allows the program to respond adaptively to its own output, maintaining variety and avoiding excessive repetition.

- **Manual Adjustment of Constraints by the Poet:** The poet has the option to adjust tags, probability factors, and content based on the output, modifying constraints iteratively to guide the program in new directions. This interaction between the poet’s adjustments and the program’s selections creates a responsive system, enabling refined, purposeful poetic evolution.

The interaction between the poet’s creative choices and the program’s structured randomness allows for a unique synthesis of intention and unpredictability, producing poems that reflect both human artistry and computational influence.

### Feedback

**Feedback** in the creation of Dunetune is both immediate, as poets review the generated output, and iterative, as they adjust parameters and constraints. Feedback mechanisms include:

- **Evaluation of Generated Output:** The poet evaluates each generated poem for aesthetic coherence and thematic alignment, deciding whether to accept, edit, or rewrite the output. This immediate feedback informs whether the program’s configuration meets the poet’s goals or requires adjustment.

- **Adjustment of Repetition Constraints Based on Output Patterns:** The poet can observe patterns in element repetition and adjust decay rates if certain words or phrases recur too frequently or too infrequently. This feedback loop helps the poet maintain the desired rhythmic quality or thematic emphasis within the poem.

- **Iterative Tuning of Element Tags and Selection Criteria:** By examining the generated structure and flow of the poem, the poet can refine the tags and selection constraints to emphasize or reduce specific themes or moods. This iterative process allows the poet to guide the poem’s development subtly, shaping the generated output in alignment with their vision.

Feedback enables poets to refine the balance between structure and spontaneity, allowing for continuous improvement and adjustment of each poem’s aesthetic and thematic quality.

### Emergence

**Emergence** in Dunetune refers to the unexpected patterns, themes, and structures that arise from the interaction of poetic content, random selection, and programmed constraints. Emergent characteristics include:

- **Unpredictable Word Combinations and Phrasing:** The quasi-random element selection leads to unique word pairings and phrases that are unlikely to occur in traditional poetry. This unpredictability results in novel, sometimes surprising connections that can add depth and intrigue to the poem’s theme.

- **Dynamic Rhythm and Structure:** The decay in repetition probability creates an emergent rhythm where certain words or phrases recur, but with less predictability than in traditional forms. This rhythm mirrors the organic flow of natural language, producing an open structure with a unique cadence that varies in each generated poem.

- **Unexpected Thematic and Narrative Coherence:** Despite the random element selection, the constraints imposed by tags and decay factors often result in emergent thematic or narrative coherence. For instance, in Dunetune, the sci-fi language inspired by *Dune* converges to create a consistent, evocative mood, even though the poem’s exact phrasing is generated dynamically.

- **Potential for Continuous Evolution:** The open form structure allows poems to evolve indefinitely by adjusting constraints and content, making each generated work unique. This potential for continuous variation introduces a sense of liveliness and flexibility, where each version of the poem feels like a distinct, self-contained creation.

Emergence in Dunetune showcases how structured randomness and poetic input can yield compositions with organic, cohesive qualities that transcend the individual constraints and random selections within the program.

In summary, **Dunetune** and the BARD 1D system exemplify a poetic system where the fusion of programmed structure and poetic intuition produces dynamic, aesthetically engaging poems. The balance of fixed constraints, adaptable variables, and emergent qualities allows for a collaborative form of poetry that reflects both human creativity and computational unpredictability, resulting in unique, richly layered poetic compositions.
