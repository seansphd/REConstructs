I'll help you create Peter Struycken's modular pattern generation system using vanilla HTML, JS, and CSS. First, let's create the modules based on the visual reference, then build the system for generating patterns.Struycken Pattern GeneratorInteractive artifactÂ I've created a complete implementation of Struycken's pattern generation system. Here's what the system includes:

Module Design: I've recreated 11 of the modules shown in the reference image using CSS. Each module is created using a combination of:

Clip paths for angular shapes
Grid layouts for the divided squares
CSS borders and backgrounds for the structured elements


Pattern Generation System:

Three different pattern sizes: 2x2, 7x7, and 10x10 blocks
Each block contains either 4x4 or 2x2 modules
Diagonal pattern structure within each block
Randomized module assignment while maintaining the structural pattern


Controls:

Buttons to generate different pattern sizes
A preview of all available modules at the top
Clean, minimal interface


Features:

Maintains the fixed constants (module designs, grid structure)
Implements variables (randomized module assignments)
Creates emergence through the interaction of modules and patterns
Generates feedback through visual assessment of patterns



You can interact with the system by:
