I'll help create a web-based implementation of the BARD 1D poetry generation system described in the text. I'll create a simple but functional version that demonstrates the key concepts.BARD 1D Poetry GeneratorInteractive artifactÂ I've created a web-based implementation of the BARD 1D poetry generation system. Here's what the system includes:

Fixed Constants:


Basic program structure for element selection and arrangement
Open form structure
Critical faculty to prevent excessive repetition
Element tags for selection criteria


Variables:


Element Deck (editable textarea for words/phrases)
Selection Criteria Tags (mood and theme filters)
Repetition Probability Factor (adjustable decay rate)
General Condition Constraints (implemented through filters)


Interaction:


Collaboration between user input and program
Guided randomness in element selection
Dynamic feedback loop in repetition control
Manual adjustment of constraints


Feedback:


Immediate visual feedback of generated poems
Real-time display of available tags
Adjustable controls for fine-tuning output


Emergence:


Unpredictable word combinations
Dynamic rhythm through probability decay
Thematic coherence through tag system

Key Features:

Edit the Element Deck with words/phrases and their tags
Adjust the repetition decay rate
Filter by mood and theme
Generate poems with varying lengths
See available tags update in real-time
Clean, modern interface

To use the system:

Edit the Element Deck with your own words/phrases
Add tags in brackets (e.g., [mood:mysterious] [theme:dune])
Adjust the decay rate slider
Select mood and theme filters if desired
Click "Generate Poem" to create a new poem

The system comes pre-loaded with some Dune-themed elements as an example, but you can modify or replace them with your own content.
Would you like me to explain any particular aspect of the implementation in more detail?
