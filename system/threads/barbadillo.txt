I'll help you create a web application that demonstrates Barbadillo's modular artwork system using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.Barbadillo Modular Art SystemInteractive artifactÂ I've created a web application that demonstrates Barbadillo's modular art system. Here's what you can do with it:

The grid shows a 4x4 arrangement of different module types (a, b, c, d)
Click any module to select it (it will be highlighted with a blue outline)
Use the controls to:

Rotate the selected module 90 degrees
Mirror the selected module horizontally
Invert the colors of the selected module


Change the primary and background colors using the color pickers

Key features implemented from Barbadillo's system:

Fixed Constants: Square grid structure and basic module shapes
Variables: Module position, rotation, reflection, and color inversion
Interaction: Modules align within the grid and can create patterns through manipulation
Feedback: Visual feedback through immediate updates when making changes
Emergence: Complex patterns emerge as you manipulate multiple modules

Feel free to experiment with different combinations! Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail or make any adjustments to the system?
