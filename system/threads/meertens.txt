I've created an interactive web application that generates letter-like shapes based on the principles described in the document. Here's what the system includes:

Fixed Constants:


Grid structure (rectangular grid of points)
Tour constraints (closed path touching each point once)
No four-square clusters rule
Connected path requirement


Variables:


Adjustable grid dimensions (width and height)
Random path configuration
Different starting points for each generation


Key Features:


Interactive controls for grid size
Visual display of the generated shapes on a canvas
Real-time generation of new shapes
Clean, minimal interface


Algorithm Details:


Uses backtracking to find valid paths
Implements the four-square cluster prevention rule
Ensures closed tours (paths return to start)
Randomized path selection for variety

To use the generator:

Adjust the grid width and height using the number inputs
Click "Generate New Shape" to create a new letter-like shape
The shape will be drawn on the canvas below the controls

The shapes are generated following these rules:

Must visit every point exactly once
Must return to the starting point
Cannot create four-square clusters
Must maintain a connected path

Each generation produces a unique shape that adheres to these constraints while maintaining the letter-like aesthetic described in the document.
Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation or make any adjustments to the generator?
