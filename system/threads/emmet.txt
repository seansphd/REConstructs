I'll help create a simplified version of Emmett's Transformation Program using vanilla HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Based on the description, we'll implement a basic system that can transform between line drawings using vector interpolation.Vector Transformation ProgramInteractive artifactÂ I've created a simplified version of Emmett's Transformation Program using vanilla HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The implementation includes:

Fixed Constants:


Vector-based drawing system
Three transformation methods (Mapper, Ganger, Shadow)
Canvas-based rendering system


Variables:


User-drawn shapes (source and target)
Choice of transformation method
Number of intermediate frames
Vector sequences


Interaction:


Click-to-draw interface on both canvases
Method selection dropdown
Frame count slider
Transform and animation controls


Feedback:


Real-time drawing visualization
Status messages
Immediate transformation preview
Animation playback


Emergence:


Different transformation methods produce unique intermediate forms
Complex interactions between source and target shapes
Various interpolation effects based on metho
