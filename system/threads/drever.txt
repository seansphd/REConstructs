I'll create a simpler 2D visualization using just vanilla JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API to demonstrate the wave interference pattern.Three-Wave Interference Pattern - Vanilla JSInteractive artifactÂ I've created a pure vanilla JavaScript implementation using the HTML Canvas API. This version includes several features that demonstrate the wave interference pattern described in the paper:

Interactive Controls:

Wave Amplitude: Adjust the height of the waves
Wavelength: Change the distance between wave peaks
Animation Speed: Control how fast the waves move
Show Nodes: Toggle visibility of the nodal points
Show Wave Lines: Toggle the visibility of the wave direction lines
Color Mode: Switch between color and grayscale visualization


Navigation Features:

Click and drag to pan around the pattern
Mouse wheel to zoom in/out
The visualization automatically centers on the screen


Key Aspects from the Paper:

Shows the interference pattern of three wave trains at 120-degree angles
Visualizes the nodes (points of zero amplitude) in red when enabled
Shows the underlying wave directions with optional grid lines
Uses color or grayscale to represent wave heights



The visualization uses the same mathematical principles described in the paper:
